		Configuration Management Tool - Ansible :::
		
		Servers are to be provision and configured Dynamically
		
		VM -AWS --> 
		
		Infra Team 
			: Server Provisioning
			: Configuration
			
		Using shell / in-house script to do such automation 
		Manually.

		Ansible :
		
			- Architecture
			- Installation & Config.
			- Components of Ansible Architecture
			- Playbooks/
			- Roles
			
		Jenkins_master 
			Slave1,2,3,4,5,6
			
			- Architecture		
			
		Ansible :: 	Uses Push Mechanism 
					Agentless 
					Used SSH connection between Ansible controller and Nodes.
					
		Ansible Components :::
			Inventory
			Ansible.config 
			Modules 
			Playbook 
				-- Script written using yaml. to exectute the modules/task in target machines.
			
		- Installation and Configuration of Ansible Controller and Nodes :::
		
		Jenkins_Master				Slave :::(created ssh keys in slave. shared the private of slave to master)
		
		
		CMS ::
		
			Ansible Controller 
								Dev :
									Ansible_Node1 - created ssh keys in slave. shared the private of slave to master
									Ansible_Node2
								Test :
									Ansible_Node1
									Ansible_Node2		
						
		
		public key.
		
		ssh key => public & private 
		
		
		Working with Ansible :::
		
			Inventory --> is used maintain the details of the target server
					hosts ==> is a default inventory file.
					
		
			Working with Ansible Modules
				Using : 	
						Adhoc Commands 
						Playbooks

			Ansible Playbooks with variables ::
			
				Environment Variables 
					
				User Defined Variables 
				
				Handling User defined Variables :::
				
					- Declare directly in playbooks using vars key
					- Handling varibles thru external variable files using vars_files Key
					- Using -e and passing as run time arguments to playbook.
		
		
			register and setup ::::
			
			
			debug --> used to print some message in target/console
			
			shell --> it used execute a shell command in target 
		
	
	Ansible Roles ::::
	
		- are used to organize the ansible components to reuse and share.
		
		
	Global Community for ansible galaxy :::
	

	Ansible :::
		
			Architecture :
				Components --> AC,Inventory,anisible.config, playbook
				SHH 
			Modules using adhoc commands, playbook 
			variable 
			handlers
			Roles 
	
	Inventory ==> 
		Static / Dynamic 
			script to create dynamic inventory files :::
				python script to 
			
	Next Modules ::
	
		Intro. Containerization ::: using Docker.
		
		Deployments :::
		
		Server 
		
		Environments 
		
		
		Virtual Machines !!!!
																			1 cpu / 16 gb ram				
			- Hardware level virtualization:::
			
			Hypervisor -- used to create VMs 
							Oracle VirtualBox 
			
			- Consume more time to bootup
			- Consume more space to save the OS
			- Slower in excuting the application 
			- It will hold the resource even if there is no application is up an running.
							
		Containerization !!!!
		
			- OS level virtualization:::

				Container Engine ==> c1,2,3,4 
				
				Container are used to run the application NOT operating system.
	
			- Containers can start quickly
			- faster in excuting the application 
			- It will release the resource if there is no application is up an running.		
		
			- Using Containers we can Reduce the no. of VMs.
